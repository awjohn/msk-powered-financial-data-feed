# Flink Java Application README

## Overview

This Flink Java Application processes stock quotes streamed via Kafka, enriching the data and sending it to various outputs, including Amazon MSK and Amazon OpenSearch. It showcases a real-time data pipeline, integrating with multiple AWS services.

## Features

- Stream processing with Apache Flink
- Real-time data enrichment
- Integration with Amazon MSK and Amazon OpenSearch
- Scalable and fault-tolerant architecture

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 11 
- Apache Maven 3.5.1 

### Build the Project

Use Maven to build the project:

```bash
mvn package
```

### Upload JAR to S3

After building the project, upload the generated JAR file, target/flink-app-1.0.jar, to your S3 bucket.

## Use Case

1. **Stock Quote Fetching**: An EC2 instance in your VPC runs a Python application fetching stock quotes from Alpacaâ€™s API.
2. **Kafka Stream**: The application sends these quotes to an Amazon MSK cluster via Kafka.
3. **Data Enrichment**: The Flink application enriches the Kafka message stream by adding indicators for significant price changes.
4. **Output to Kafka**: The enriched data is sent to a separate Kafka stream on Amazon MSK.
5. **Output to OpenSearch**: The enriched data is also sent to Amazon OpenSearch for storage and future querying.
6. **Customer Consumption**: A Kafka consumer application in a separate VPC consumes the enriched data feed securely using AWS PrivateLink.

## Project Structure

- **src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/msf/StreamingJob.java**: Contains the main application code.
- **src/main/resources**: Contains configuration files and other resources.
- **pom.xml**: Project dependencies, plugins, and other build configurations
- **README.md**: This file.

## Developing Your Flink Application

### Main Class

The entry point of the Flink application is the main class, which sets up the execution environment and defines the data processing pipeline.

Example:

```java
public class YourMainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Set up the execution environment
        final StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();

        // Configure your pipeline
        DataStream<String> input = env.addSource(new YourSourceFunction());
        DataStream<String> processed = input.map(new YourMapFunction());
        processed.addSink(new YourSinkFunction());

        // Execute the pipeline
        env.execute("Flink Java Application");
    }
}
```

### Custom Operators

Implement custom operators such as `MapFunction`, `FlatMapFunction`, `FilterFunction`, etc., to define your data transformations.

Example:

```java
public class YourMapFunction implements MapFunction<String, String> {
    @Override
    public String map(String value) throws Exception {
        // Your transformation logic
        return value.toUpperCase();
    }
}
```
